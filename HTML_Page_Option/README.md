### Windows 10:

Open [MsftRewards.html](/HTML_Page_Option/MsftRewards.html) in MS Edge (for maximum points, non MS Edge will still work but you may not get as many points)

Example CLI to do so: *(You will need to update {PATH_TO_FILE} to be correct)*

`"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe" file:///{PATH_TO_FILE}\MsftRewards.html"`

Once the page has loaded, click the button to run. Once it is done running check your rewards page to be sure you got the points. (It may need 60s to load the points after the rapid searches) 

**__NOTE: IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME RUNNING THE MsftRewards.html file you will need to allow popups when it asks for your permission__**


*Open an issue if this is very different for other OS i guess*
