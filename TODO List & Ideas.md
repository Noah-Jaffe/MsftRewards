### PC & MOBILE SEARCHES
for better automating of the phone and pc searching, can we do one of the following
1. make an azure web app, have it auto run once per day and make the different search calls with different spoofed headers to count towards the searches?
     
    1a. Will this be free? For how long? Otherwise can we get it for free?

    1b. Could this use the Bing web search API?

    1c. Could this also handle visiting the news pages?
 
 2. Make a python script that auto runs that spoofs headers to make the search



### MOBILE:
Would it be easier to use a mobile emulator to do this all from a single pc device?
This breaks our lightweight goal, but tradeoff is we can guarantee that we're all PC and can fully automate that way?
Could potentially compare reward amounts for the different tasks?
