### PC & MOBILE SEARCHES
for better automating of the phone and pc searching, can we do one of the following
 1. make an azure web app, have it auto run once per day and make the different search calls with different spoofed headers to count towards the searches?
   1a. Will this be free? For how long? Otherwise can we get it for free?
 2. Make a python script that auto runs that spoofs headers to make the search
