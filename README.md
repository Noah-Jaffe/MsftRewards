# MsftRewards
Msft Rewards automation

## v1.0
This version seems to work on Edge (110.0.1587.69) for windows 10

## How to use v1.0
This automates the searching for your desktop browser.
You can do this via the [HTML Page Option](/HTML_Page_Option) or the [Dev Console option](/Dev_Console_option)

## To run the dev console option:
See the [file in the folder](/Dev_Console_option/README.md) for full detailed instructions


## To run the HTML page:
### Windows 10:

Open [MsftRewards.html](/HTML_Page_Option/MsftRewards.html) in MS Edge (for maximum points, non MS Edge will still work but you may not get as many points)

Example CLI to do so: *(You will need to update {PATH_TO_FILE} to be correct)*

`"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe" file:///{PATH_TO_FILE}\MsftRewards.html"`

Once the page has loaded, click the button to run. Once it is done running check your rewards page to be sure you got the points. (It may need 60s to load the points after the rapid searches)
