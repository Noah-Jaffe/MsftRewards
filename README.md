# MsftRewards
Msft Rewards automation

## v1.0
This version seems to work on Edge (110.0.1587.69) for windows 10


## To run:
### Windows 10:

Open MsftRewards.html in MS Edge (for maximum points, non MS Edge will still work but you may not get as many points)

Example CLI to do so: *(You will need to update {PATH_TO_FILE} to be correct)*

`"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe" file:///{PATH_TO_FILE}\MsftRewards.html"`

Once the page has loaded, click the button to run. Once it is done running check your rewards page to be sure you got the points. (It may need 60s to load the points after the rapid searches)
