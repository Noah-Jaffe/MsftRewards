## FAQ:
### Q: Why is this structured so weirdly?
A: Because as the new solutions to the automation come out it might make sense for a version to change to a python only based solution, instead of keeping it as vanilla and non intrusive as possible. Also, I am not the brightest.

### Q: Help, I don't really understand how to use this or what I am supposed to do.
A: Try googling the terms you are not familiar with, if that does not help answer your question, just open an issue so I can update stuff to be easier to understand.
